# stemwayLearningStyleTest




 After completing the contact form project for Stemway, I had a chance to complete another project for the tutoring agency. Stemway tutors had an innovative approach to teaching students - tutors would determine student learning styles and then adapt their teaching style to align their teaching with the student learning preference. Stemway wanted this learning style test to be available to anyone, even those who are not current Stemway clients. The business hoped this test would attract additional traffic to their website and increase the rate of website visitor conversion to paid clients.

 A similar project was done with Neon Learner, which provided valuable insights into the implementation of learning style assessments. Stemway wanted a cost-effective solution, so they preferred the test to be multiple choice rather than LLM integration to evaluate open-ended questions. This approach ensured that the test could be easily scaled and maintained without significant additional costs. Moreover, the multiple-choice format allowed for quicker and more straightforward analysis of user responses, ensuring a seamless user experience. The goal was to create a robust yet simple evaluation tool that could handle a high volume of users simultaneously. By focusing on multiple-choice questions, Stemway could also ensure that the test remained accessible to users with varying levels of technical proficiency. The decision to avoid complex integrations also meant that the development timeline could be shortened, allowing the test to be deployed rapidly. Additionally, the simplicity of the multiple-choice format allowed for easy updates and iterations based on user feedback, ensuring the test remained relevant and effective over time.

To create the learning style evaluation test, I chose to work with a familiar setup: AWS Lambda functions for user answer processing and email sending, while using markup languages to build the user interface.

The Stemway learning style questionnaire was made public. Users could discover their learning style at zero cost and read more about their learning profile. Explicit results could also be delivered to user email if website visitors requested full results.

Stemway website traffic increased due to the free learning style test available on their website. The automated solution also reduced the operational overhead for Stemway tutors and saved them time, since the test could be done remotely without needing any manual intervention.
