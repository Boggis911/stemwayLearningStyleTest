# stemwayLearningStyleTest




After completing the contact form project for Stemway,
I had a chance to complete another project for the tutoring agency. Stemway tutors
had an innovative approach to teachng students - tutors would determine student
learning styles and then adapt their teaching style to allign their teaching 
with the student learning preference. Stemway wanted this learning style test
to be available to anyone, even those who are not current Stemway clients.
The business hoped this test would attract additional traffic to their website
and increase the rate of website visitor conversion to paid clients.



A similar project was done with neon learner.
Stemway wanted a cost effective solution so they prefered the test to be multiple choice
rather than LLM integration to evaluate open-ended questions.



To create the learning style evaluation test, I chose to work with a familiar setup:
AWS lambda functions for user answer processing and email sending, while using 
the markup languages to build the user interface



Stemway learning style questionaire was made public. Users could discover their learning
style at zero cost and read more about their learning profile. Explicit results
could also be delivered to user email if website visitors requested full results.



Stemway website traffic increased due to free learning style test available on their website.
The automated solution also reduced the operational overhead for Stemway tutors 
and saved them time, since the test could be done
remotely without needing any manual intervention.
